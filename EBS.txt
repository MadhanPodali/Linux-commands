TO CREATE EC2 INSTNACE AND CREATE EBS VOLUMES AND ATTACH IT TO SERVER

      lsblk  

      df -Th

      file -s /dev/xvdk = It doesn't have file system, so it will display as (data) 
                         
      file -s /dev/xvda1 = It has file system ,it's a root volume 

      mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdk = It will create a new file system for the volume 
                              But, before creating a new file system for the volume check weather the volume consist of file sys or not.
                              Here, if u create a new file sys for the volume the existing file sys will deleted and data will be erased. 

      mkdir ytvolume  = It will create a new directory to mount  a new volume 

      ls

     mount /dev/xvdk ytvolume/ = Here the new volume will be mounted to the new directory

     df -Th =  To check weather the new volume is mounted or not 

     cat /etc/mtab  = copy the last entry point and paste it in fstab 

     vim /etc/fstab = By doing this even if we reboot the server the volume will be mounted to the server and the data will be safe 

     mount -all

     lsblk

     df -Th

     xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/ytvolume = It will increase the existing volume to the newly updated size . (ex:- 2gb to 4gb)

     umount /dev/xvdk =  To unmount the volume from the server. 

    


TO INCREASE THE ROOT VOULUME ADN DISPLY

  yum install xfsprogs
  
  sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

  


To create a ec2 instance with cli command :
-------------------------------------------
 
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0453ec754f44f9a4a --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name newkey --security-group-ids sg-077d9c6540f8b4990 --subnet-id subnet-0e694a62a7ebc6112



CRON-JOB :
---------

Create a cronjob and execute a shell script every 5mins to create a file , filename = today's date and time
 
 
yum install cronie -y
1) vi script.sh ( create a file with script.sh)
 
#!/bin/bash
OUTPUT_DIR="/home/ec2-user/crontab"
FILENAME=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S").txt
touch "$OUTPUT_DIR/$FILENAME"
2) crontab -e
 
*/5 * * * * /home/ec2-user/script.sh
 
3) chmod +x script.sh
