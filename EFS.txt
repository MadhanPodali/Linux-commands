To Create a EFS :
----------------

1) First we need to create a new security group -> choose NFS port and apply it to the servers

2) Go EFS and create a file sys , and after creating 

3) Click on attach and u can find (Using the NFS client) and copy that url

4) Create a new directory in the servers (ex: new)

  (sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0802e4d5f379899ab.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ new/) Replace your directory under new/

5) Now the efs will get mounted to the server 

6) open cat /etc/mtab/ --> copy the last pointer and paste it in (vim /etc/fstab)

7) Now by doing this even if the server gets rebooted the data will not get erased
